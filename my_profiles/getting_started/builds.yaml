# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes one minimal global build.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/parameters.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# Define input files.
inputs:
  - name: example-data
    metadata: data/example_metadata.tsv
    sequences: data/example_sequences.fasta.gz

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.
builds:
  # This build samples evenly from the globe
  # with a build name that will produce the following URL fragment on Nextstrain/auspice:
  # /ncov/global
  global:
    subsampling_scheme: region_global
    region: global

# Here, you can specify what type of auspice_config you want to use
# and what description you want. These will apply to all the above builds.
# If you want to specify specific files for each build - you can!
# See the 'example_advanced_customization' builds.yaml
files:
  auspice_config: "my_profiles/example/my_auspice_config.json"
  description: "my_profiles/example/my_description.md"
